# SQLInjectHunter
Automating SQL Injection Vulnerability Verification through HTTP Response Length Analysis using Python

  The primary objective of this project is to create a Python-based system that could simulate SQL Injection attacks by sending multiple malicious payloads to the target web application and then analyzing the response length that the server returns. In which the system will automatically detect the difference in response lengths, indicating any potential vulnerability, and then report the outcome to the user.
